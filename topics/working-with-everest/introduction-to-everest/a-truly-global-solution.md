# A Truly Global Solution

Everest works for businesses which are global in nature. It is especially suited for businesses that have operations in more than one country. You can configure Everest to deal with country-specific requirements such as taxes, time zones, reports, addresses and zip codes, telephone formats, and currencies. 

Everest is also multi-currency enabled. It handles complex transactions that involve more than two currencies and automatically computes the gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions.
